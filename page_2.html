        <h2>Watercolor Paints</h2>
        <p>
            There are a lot of different watercolor paints. What sets watercolor paints apart from other paints 
            is that it is made from pigments that are mixed and suspended in a binder which is a water-based solution. 
            The need to add water to the paints to create the perfect wash is what characterizes it as watercolor paint. 
            There are liquid base paints, hard powder paints, and even water color pencils and within all of these 
            different types of watercolor paints, they come in two grades. Artist or Professional grade paints are usually 
            a more expensive paint because they are richer in color and have more vibrant mixes due to usually being formulated 
            using a single pigment. Then there are student grade paints which are much lower in quality and made using less 
            concentrated pigment and more often are formulated using two or more less expensive pigments. The more high quality the 
            paint, the longer the artwork will last over time.
