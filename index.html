        <P>Watercolor is not only a paint but also the art or method of painting, and a type of picture or design. 
            The earliest watercolor paintings date back to ancient times. Prehistoric humans would create cave paintings 
            in the Paleolithic ages. Natural pigments like ochre, charcoal, and other ground minerals were used by them to paint 
            on the walls like this image to the right of the <strong>Lascaux Cave paintings in France dating 17,000 – c. 15,000 BCE</strong>. 
            Egyptians would use watercolors to paint on papyrus like the partial image to the right of the <strong>Funerary Papyrus of 
            the Steward Sethnakht - ca. 1320–1200 B.C.</strong> Around 4000 B.C.E. is when Chinese watercolor paintings developed. And, in 
            Europe around the 15th and 16th century during the Renaissance is when advanced watercolor paintings started to emerge. 
            There are now many different types of watercolor paints, papers, brushes, etc used to make beautiful watercolor paintings. Please 
            take a look through my webpage to learn more!
