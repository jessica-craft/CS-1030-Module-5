        <h2>Watercolor Brushes</h2>
        <p>
            In ancient times, humans used their fingers, sticks, bones, and other simple tools made with feathers or animal 
            hair to apply the paints for their cave paintings. Since then, the modern watercolor brush has evolved 
            considerably.

        <p>
            There are three parts to the paint brush. The tuft is the part that is used to pick up the paint and apply it to the paper. It 
            is made of a bundle of animal hairs or synthetic fibers (or even sometimes a blend of both) that are tied tightly together at the 
            base of the brush. The ferrule is a little metal or plastic sleeve that goes around the tuft and gives the tift its shape, provides 
            the mechanical support from pressure, and protects the glued area between the base of the tift and the handle from water damage. The 
            handle is usually made from wood or plastic and it is typically made to be shorter in a watercolor brush than in an acrylic or oil 
            painting brush. One distinct feature of the watercolor brush is it has a distint shape that is widest in the area just behind the ferrule 
            and then tapers to the tip. Another distinct feature of the watercolor brush that sets it apart from other brushes are the bristles. The 
            bristles are picked for their softness and how absorbent they are. Since watercolor uses water with its paints, the brush needs to be able 
            to handle anywhere from a little bit of water to a lot of water. The more water that is used, the thinner and more transparent of a wash we 
            are able to create with the paint. The less water that is used, the more richer and opaque the colors are and it allows layering to get more 
            depth to your watercolor paintings.
